# count-down

### A Note about using this element
I couldn't figure out a way to import countdown.js as an es6 module
so anything that uses ``<count-down>`` needs to include the script in their html page.
See the index.html demo page for an example.

Start a development environment with:

```
make
```
Then, the first time:

```
yarn install
polymer serve --hostname 0.0.0.0
```

or just

```
polymer serve --hostname 0.0.0.0
```
